## Data wrangling of text data

In this notebook, I explore how to clean up text data about wine reviews that were made available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
Here are the different tasks that were performed:

* Dupplicates
* Missing values
* Feature engineering
* Pre-processing
    - Stripping away the punctuation
    - Removing stop-words
    - Convert all the characters to lowercase
    - Tokenizing each words
    - Removing all alpha numeric characters like 123456{}#$?*)
* Sentiment score from lexicon based framework.
